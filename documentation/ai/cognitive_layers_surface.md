# Cognitive Layer — Surface / Presentation

## Role
The Surface layer presents the final output to the user.

This is where:
- tone
- pacing
- formatting
- subtle cues (“body language”)

are applied.

## Responsibilities
- Express effort level implicitly (as defined by the Gatekeeper)
- Maintain a single, coherent voice
- Avoid leaking internal deliberation unless requested

## Signals
- Concise vs exploratory language
- Cautious vs decisive phrasing
- Optional expandable sections (UI)

## Design principle
The user interacts with **one system**, not its internals.
